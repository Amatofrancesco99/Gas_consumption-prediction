% Save the table information in two dataset, each for a year
% selecting only the data Iâ€™m interested viewing
dsYear1=readtable('./Dataset/gasITAday.xlsx', 'Range', 'A3:C367');
dsYear2=readtable('./Dataset/gasITAday.xlsx', 'Range', 'A368:C732');

% Change the coloumn's name in the different datasets
dsYear1.Properties.VariableNames{1}='DayOfTheYear';
dsYear1.Properties.VariableNames{2}='DayOfTheWeek';
dsYear1.Properties.VariableNames{3}='GasConsumption';

dsYear2.Properties.VariableNames{1}='DayOfTheYear';

title('GAS CONSUMPTION IN ITALY -- Year 2');

end

% FIRST OBSERVATIONS:
% From the diagrams we can already notice that the gas consumption decreases 
% in the hottest months of the year, more specifically in the days that go 
% from the 120th (April) to the 290th (September).
% So we can say that this trend are both seasonal, with a periodicity 
% of about 6 months.

% WHY THIS HAPPENS (QUITE OBVIOUS)? 
% Natural gas consumption has two seasonal peaks, largely reflecting
% weather-related fluctuations in energy demand. 
% In the winter months, cold weather leads to more demand for heating in 
% the residential and commercial sectors. 
% In the summer months, warm weather leads to more demand for air conditioning 
% and, in turn, more demand for electricity.

% FIRST OBSERVATIONS:
% From the diagrams we can already notice that the gas consumption decreases 
% in the hottest months of the year, more specifically in the days that go 
% from the 120th (April) to the 290th (September).
% So we can say that this trend are both seasonal, with a periodicity 
% of about 6 months.

% WHY THIS HAPPENS (QUITE OBVIOUS)? 
% Natural gas consumption has two seasonal peaks, largely reflecting
% weather-related fluctuations in energy demand. 
% In the winter months, cold weather leads to more demand for heating in 
% the residential and commercial sectors. 
% In the summer months, warm weather leads to more demand for air conditioning 
% and, in turn, more demand for electricity.

% FIRST (EASY) OBSERVATIONS:
% From the diagrams we can already notice that the gas consumption decreases 
% in the hottest months of the year, more specifically in the days that go 
% from the 120th (April) to the 290th (September).
% So we can say that this trend are both seasonal, with a periodicity 
% of about 6 months.

% WHY THIS HAPPENS (QUITE OBVIOUS)? 
% Natural gas consumption has two seasonal peaks, largely reflecting
% weather-related fluctuations in energy demand. 
% In the winter months, cold weather leads to more demand for heating in 
% the residential and commercial sectors. 
% In the summer months, warm weather leads to more demand for air conditioning 
% and, in turn, more demand for electricity.

% ANOTHER OBSERVATION:
% Considered a specific weekly window (7 days), we can see that during the 
% weekends the gas consumption is lower than the other 5 days of that same
% week.

% SOME MATHEMATICAL OBSERVATIONS:
% From the 2D graph of the two signals (gas consumption, depending on the day 
% of the year and the day of the week), we can also notice that it is a discrete
% time stationary signal.
% Stationary as if we took two sufficiently distant windows we can see that 
% the trend seems to be similar (except for small oscillations due to noise),
% more specifically if we consider windows spaced 6 months concatenating the
% two years (taking December of year 1 and chaining it with January of year 2).
% Discrete time because the realizations have been taken only once a day for
% a year and not for every moment of time of every day of a year (reasonable 
% enough because we do not care to know the gas consumption per second, but 
% in a whole day). 
% We can also notice that the signal sign stay positive (January-April)
% then falls (April-September), then goes higher (Semptember-April_Year 2).
% Finally we can say that its autocovariance function will be centered around
% an average value (average gas consumption in a year, which corresponds to 
% the sum of daily gas consumption in a year / the number of days in a year), 
% and will have a fairly slow decline (because it remains positive for 6 
% months, then it goes down). 
% So its Fourier transform (of the autocovariance) will be a fairly "fat"
% and "low" Gaussian (slow decay and always centered around the average value 
% previously mentioned).

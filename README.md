# Model Identification and Data Analysis - PROJECT

## Overview
The topic of this project is: **"Long-Term Time-Series forecasting, using model identification theory"**. 

Starting from a dataset, which concerns *two years gas consumption trend in Italy in function of two parameters* (day of the year, day of the week), we want to identify the model which represents our data in the better way. 
Afterwards, we created a function that predicts the gas consumption, once you insert the value of the parameters mentioned before.

In order to identify the best model that represents our time series process we used: *polynomial regression*, *neural networks* and finally *harmonic regression*.

## Script
Watch the *"live_script"* code, in the [*"Scripts"* folder](https://github.com/filsky0599/Progetto-IMAD/tree/main/Scripts) of this repository, if you're interested in and you want more details (how we implemented it, using *Matlab*)

## Presentation
[Here](https://github.com/filsky0599/Progetto-IMAD/tree/main/Presentation/FileExtension) you can find the project presentation, in different extensions (pdf or pptx).

We suggest you downloading *.pptx* file, because 3D animation videos we putted in our presentation are not available if you download the *.pdf* version.

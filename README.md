# Model Identification and Data Analysis - PROJECT

## Overview
The topic of this project is: **"Long-Term Time-Series forecasting, using model identification theory"**. 

Using a dataset we want to identify the model which represents our data in the better way. So we created a function that predicts the gas consumption (in Italy) in a specific day of the year, and of the week. 

To identify the best model that represents our time series function (gas consumption in Italy, during two different years) we used: *polynomial regression*, *neural networks* and finally *harmonic regression*.

[Here](https://github.com/filsky0599/Progetto-IMAD/tree/main/Presentation/FileExtension) you can find the project presentation, in different extensions (pdf or pptx).

We suggest you downloading *.pptx* file, because 3D animation videos we putted in our presentation are not available if you download the *.pdf* version.

# Model Identification and Data Analysis - PROJECT

## Overview
The topic of this project is: **"Long-Term Time-Series forecasting, using model identification theory"**. 

Starting from a dataset, which concerns *two years gas consumption trend in Italy in function of two parameters* (day of the year, day of the week), we want to identify the model which represents our data in the better way. 
Afterwards, we created a function that predicts the gas consumption value, using the best identified model, once you insert a tuple composed by the two parameters mentioned before.

In order to identify the best model that represents our time series process we used: *polynomial regression*, *neural networks* and finally *harmonic regression*.

## Script
If you're interested in how we solve model identification, comparison between models, gas consumption prediction, and many other things ( using *Matlab* ), watch the *"live_script.mlx"* code. 
You can find it at this [folder](https://github.com/filsky0599/Progetto-IMAD/tree/main/Scripts).

It is also available, at the same link, another file including solely the prediction function (for more details, see the *prediz.m* script).

## Presentation
At this [link](https://github.com/filsky0599/Progetto-IMAD/tree/main/Presentation/FileExtension) you can find the project presentation, in different extensions (pdf or pptx).

We suggest you downloading *.pptx* file, because 3D animation videos we putted in our presentation are not available if you download the *.pdf* version.

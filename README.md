# Model Identification and Data Analysis - PROJECT

## Overview
The topic of this project is: **"Long-Term Time-Series forecasting, using model identification theory"**. 

Using a dataset we want to identify the model which better represent our data, to then create a function that predicts the gas consumption (in Italy) in a specific day of the year, and of the week. 

To identify the best model that represent our time series function (gas consumption in Italy, during two different years) we've used: *polynomial regression*, *neural networks* and finally *harmonic regression*.
